# 1. What is CDN and why it is used ?
- CDN stands for <b>Contect delivery network</b>, a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location.

- <b>Global Network of Servers:</b> CDNs consist of multiple servers spread across different geographic locations worldwide.

- <b>Reduced Latency:</b> By delivering content from the nearest server to the user, a CDN reduces the time it takes to load a webpage.

- <b>Improved Load Times:</b> CDN minimizes the distance between the server and the user, resulting in faster loading times for websites.

- <b>Content Caching:</b> CDNs cache static content (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) on multiple servers, so itâ€™s delivered from the closest location.

- <b>Better User Experience:</b> Faster page loading times enhance the user experience, improving retention and engagement.

- <b>Scalability:</b> CDNs handle high traffic loads, allowing websites to scale up and accommodate more users without slowing down.

- <b>Security:</b> Many CDNs provide additional security features like DDoS protection, secure data transmission (SSL), and web application firewalls.

- <b>Cost-Efficient:</b> CDNs offload traffic from origin servers, reducing bandwidth costs and improving server performance.

- <b>Improved SEO:</b> Fast-loading websites are favored by search engines, improving search ranking and visibility.

- <b>Redundancy and Reliability:</b> If one CDN server fails, another nearby server can take over, ensuring uninterrupted content delivery.
